# Implementation of Various ML Techniques

This repository contains implementations of ML Techniques.

**For now the repository contains a basic TEster for Gradient Descent and  Normal equation method (for LInear Regression) . Futuure vision to to extend this repository to include ADvanced MAchine Learning Techniques.**

**Guidlines--> Collaborators may take inspiration for the given Gradient_DEscent_Tester and NOrmal_Equation_TEster, may even have a look at LInear REgression.cpp file in ./Trading_Strategies
to create (in a similar context) advanced Trategies Startegies.**
